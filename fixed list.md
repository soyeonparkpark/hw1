When I did this homework, I was inspired by bubble games where many bubbles move and push.

Size: I changed the circle radius: random(100, 100)

Color: I choose a yellow color for the bubbles. And when you hover, it become transparent and green.

Movement: Rather using one bubble, I made the many bubbles and Their size grows and shrinks.
The speed is 'frameRate(100)' .

Number: The number of bubbles is 100.
